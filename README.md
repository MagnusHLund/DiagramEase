# DiagramEase

This project is VERY early on, WIP (Work In Progress).
The vision for this project i: 
1. It should be able to export the diagrams to PNG, JPG and maybe PDF.
2. Should have multiple tabs open, with different diagrams
3. Save diagram as a unique file type
4. Be able to create UML and mock-ups
5. Arrows should be either straight or have 90 degree angles
6. Everything should be grid based, so the diagram is easy to make straight.
7. Allow zoom
8. Allow text on the diagram.
9. Allow importing PNG and JPG to the app, which can be used to create diagrams with.
10. Program should have a modern look.
11. Editing page size

If those requriements ever get met, then it would be cool to have a basic system that can detect C# code and make automatic diagrams based on certian keywords such as creating instances of new classes.

This project will most likely never get finished, however this is the vision.
